## so where is the CODE?
When you browse source files you may wonder where is the source code? How is this working? 
Well, it's based on [OrchadCore](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore) so all the CMS features come from *OrchardCore.Application.Cms.Targets* package from *orchard-preview* nuget feed on myget

here we will add our custom modules on top of OrchardCore applicaiton framework
